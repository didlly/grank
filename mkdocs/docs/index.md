Grank is a feature rich Dank Memer automation program that is open-source and free to use, as well as having many self-bot commands to make using Grank easier. Grank is inspired by [dankgrinder](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder). Since dankgrinder has been discontinued and the [recommended fork](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/dankgrinder) has also been discontinued, I decided to make my own version from scratch in Python. Grank is as good as, if not better, than dankgrinder.
